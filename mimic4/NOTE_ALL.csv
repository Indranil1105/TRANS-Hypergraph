breath likely due to worsening intrapulmonary tumor burden and later underwent percutaneous liver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon cancer prompting transfer to the oncology service and eventually discharged home with hospiceactive issues1 metastatic colon adenocarcinoma cta to exclude pulmonary embolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission demonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic cancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs which had evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient reluctance to engage with care percutaneous liver biopsy ultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma following discussion with her outpatient oncology providers she was transferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential trial of flox however given the patients very poor functional and nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with the patients hcp  and it was decided to focus goals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient was discharged home with home hospice 2 left thigh weaknessspinous tenderness she was found to have focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse spinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of preserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia she was noted to be incontinent of urine but not feces given underlying malignancy there was concern for bony metastases or cord involvement with alternative consideration given to epidural abscess prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycincefepim  to  despite frequent persuasive efforts she declined multiple attempts at lumbosacral mri including with lorazepam premedication citing claustrophobia neuro exam was monitored and remained stable3 abdominal pain she experienced intermittent abdominal pain and tenderness without peritoneal signs concerning for obstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy particularly given episodes of emesishematemesis as below while multiple kubs were negative for obstruction ct abdomen was planned to evaluate for alternative sources of intraabdominal pathology but she declined on multiple occasions pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol as needed4  hematemesis she experienced a single episode of small volume emesis reportedly approximately 100cc streaked with blood and found to be guiac positive vital signs and hematocrit remained stable iv pantoprazole was initiated for gastrointestinal prophylaxis with subsequent discontinuation of ppi given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was true blood vs red popsicle was eating at time esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of recurrent hematemesis no prior egds were available in omr 5 altered mental status she was intermittently altered throughout admission never oriented to more than person and place with occasional difficulty following simple commands as compared to an uncertain baseline infectious work up including blood and urine cultures and cta on admission with subsequent cxrs was unrevealing noncontrast head ct was negative for acute intracranial process brain mri for definitive exclusion of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobiamri aversion as above  abg on  without signs of co2 retention history of opiates making patient sleepy per hcp as possible contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic lesions to liver and asterixis on exam  ams could also be  to severe depression mental status monitored and remained stable and patient at baseline per hcp on discharge6 shortness of breath she presented with acute onset shortness of breath without frank hypoxia cta on admission was negative for pulmonary embolus though subsegmental clot could not be excluded definitively pleural effusion or focal infiltrate ekg and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against acute coronary syndrome  low voltages on ekg were consistent with prior hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission without dedicated treatment with the exception of nebulizers and expectorants as needed7 leukocytosis white blood cell count was elevated and peaked at 206 consistent with recent baseline likely reflecting underlying malignancy as noted above infectious work up including cta urine and blood cultures and cxrs was unrevealing she remained afebrile with the exception of isolated transient fever to 100 with stable vital signs 8 liver function test abnormalities ast remained elevated  to  alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s and total bilirubin 21 to 26 likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or obstructive process the possibility of superimposed intraabdominal process such as infection could not be excluded in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above but she declined ct for further evaluation9 elevated lactate lactate was found to be 2738 throughout admission despite copious iv fluids likely reflecting compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant infiltration 10 sinus tachycardia she remained persistently tachycardic 100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor po intake but incompletely responsive to copious iv fluids tachycardia has been present since at least  despite concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate there was no clear infectious source hence low suspicion for sepsis subsegmental pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of admission cta but shortness of breath was short lived and she was never hypoxic hematocrit remained stable without signs of active bleeding with the

hypoxia found to have pancolitis and pneumonia septic shock due to cdiff colitis on admission meet criteria for sepsis given fever tachycardia leukocytosis and likely source being colitis bp remained low and patient remained mildly tachycardic for next  requiring aggressive ivf roughly 20l in first 72hrs initially started on iv flagylpo vanco emperically for possible cdiff as well as levofloxacin over concern for pna bcx ucx unrevealing stool for cdiff ultimately positive and levofloxacin changed to ctxazithro pcp dr  visited and said that pt always has cxr infiltrate so abx for ctxazithro for pneumonia stopped after pt had received total of 3 days pna treatment lactate and wbc count trended up in first 48hrs and patient developed ileus on abdominal imaging with worsening distension gi and

improving with downtrending wbc came back to icu on  due to respiratory distress and hypoxia also had to be started back on pressors initially phenylephrine but then this was stopped as extremities

recommended starting tigecycline to help cover cdiff which she completed an 8 day course of abdominal exam improved and ileus resolved doboff was placed on  and tube feeds were started due poor ability to keep with with nutritional requirements metronidazole dcd on  plan to continue vancomycin 500mg po q6 for a total of 2 weeks after all other antibiotics were stopped last day  hypoxia no breathing issues at baseline but developed hypoxia requiring 5l nc while in ed so was admitted to the icu initial concern for rll pna on cxr and received 3 days of abx as noted above until pcp

aggressive ivf in first 72hrs and the development of pleural effusions had started diuresis by micu callout on  but then after couple days on floor triggered for hypoxia and increased work of

done with with acs cs  given lack of microrganisms on the gram stain and pmns likely cw inflammation steroids were started once an infx was ro  the patient was also seen by  who recommended outpt  as

with pmr however reassured pattern does not seem cw this  esr and crp were checked which were elevated 87 and 243 respectively  blood cx were also checked given possible pyomyositis thought from diabetic foot ulcer however they remained ngtd throughout hospitalization  rheumatology was cs who felt that mri thigh was indicated which showed unilateral myositis in the left quadriceps group  notably on exam the patient seemed to show pain to both passive and active movement and as such we felt that he likely had both a problem in his joints as well as the actual muscles  a muscle biopsy was done with the  team cs which upon initial gram stain was negative for microorganisms which allowed us to start steroids we were concerned about possible pyomyositis  also of concern was diabetic myonecrosis however unlikely given that multiple mm groups with different blood supply was involved  rheumatology felt it was possible that the pain in both the left ac joint as well as the pes anserinus on the right leg which developed on hd3 may both be crystal arthropathybursitis and as such recommended steroids  we held off on empiric steroids until after the bx and upon initiation drastic improvement on sxs was noted  ultimately thought was that possibly myositis  traumatic fall on left hand side with underlying crystal arthropathy however not enough fluid on mri or us to tap  he will have rheumatology fu in the  system and our rheumatology cs attdg will attempt to contact his outpt rheumatologist for continuity of care  he was discharged with a prednisone taper and close fu with his pcp acute renal failure  fena was 1 and buncr ratio 10  as such thought was that this was likely prerenal  with hydration cr down to 10  nsaids were attempted for pain relief which helped unfortunately his cr again bumped so nsaids were discontinued and the patient was asked to avoid them at time of discharge   diabetes  continued home regimen of lantus and hiss  notably pt did have higher blood sugars upon initation of his steroids  the patient was advised to closely monitor his bs at home to cover himself with ssi  notably diabetic myonecrosis was on the ddx however we felt this was unlikely given the location of the myositis  there was also thought of possible contribution of his diabetes and insulin usage to a possible adhesive capsulitis in the left shoulder anemia pts hct was 40 upon presentation and dropped to 32 over his hospitalization in the setting of aggressive hydration for arf  notably guaiac was negative and iron studies were cw anemia of chronic inflammation constipation pt developed narcotic induced constipation and an aggressive bowel regimen was written for him  he required an enema in order to pass stools and as such he was discharged with an aggressive prescription regimen for his constipation foot ulcer pt has known dm with foot ulcer followed by podiatry  wound cs was asked to see patient who assisted with foot ulcer care  no

admission for dilt gtt acute of chronic kidney injury osteomyelitis from sacral decubitus ulcer now transferred to  for debridement of sacral ulcer  became hypotensive and quite anemic on the floor with hh of  and was transferred to the micu    she peacefully passed away with her family and family pastor present in the room at  on   hypercarbic respiratory failure the pt consistently required nasal cannula up to 6 l while on the floor this was thought to be due to volume overload and increased work of breathing while in the ccu pt became more lethargic and an abg showed hypercarbic respiratory failure  she was intubated by anesthesia  cxr showed large bilateral pleural effusions and she was grossly anasarcic  ip placed a right chest tube to drain the effusion which showed that it was malignant with cytology showing adenocarcinoma  she was extubated successfully on  and was weaned down to room air thereafter  she was able to be comfortable on room air for the rest of her admission encephalopathy although the pts mental status had noticed to be declining on the floor she was still able to answer appropriately after extubation the pt was noted to be very lethargic and minimally responsive eeg was done which showed triphasic waves consistent with an encephalopathy the pt was trialed on ativan and keppra her mental status remained very poor in spite of continued keppra  neuro signed off after head imaging was unrevealing  mental status continued to wax and wane through the rest of her time  stage iv surgical dehiscence patient had correction of abdominoperineal resection defect with a right vertical rectus abdominis muscular cutaneous flap in  following resection of anal cancer she presented to the hospital with stage iv mrsa  sacral ulcer with concern for osteomyelitis as wound probes to bone ct scan with no mention of sacral osteomyelitis gi deferred to plastics as they did flap surgery plastics does not recommend surgical intervention at this time mri shows no signs of osteomyelitis this wound remained stable during her hospital course   baseline creatinine 08 creatinine on admission was 21 in setting of diuresis but also possible hypotension from afib with rvr pt is grossly volume overloaded with hypoalbumenemia concern for prerenal vs intrinsic with possible multiple myeloma involvement vs obstructive creatinine remains above 20 today renal consulted and believed that her  was predominantly secondary to obstruction after stent exchange by urology  renal function improved with a cr to 15 with iv fluids and remained stable   gastric distension patient developed nausea and 1 episode of vomiting  with increasing distention and xray  showed significant gastric distension ng tube was placed and 1l was drawn off patients reported symptomatic improvement patient continued to have ostomy output throughout episode no mass appreciated on exam though obese abdomen patient not on narcotic medication on  ng tube was clamped without recurrence of distention patient denies nausea or distension unable to get ct abd due to poor kidney function but got osh ct read by our radiologists it was notable for new retroperitoneal mass encasing aorta throughout abdomen it is touching and possibly invading  and  portion of duodenum potentially explaining gastric obstruction symptoms invades pancreatic head explaining ductal dilatation also surrounding common iliac vessels and both ureters hydronephrosis worse since  speech and swallow was consulted who said the pt should be strict npo tube feeds were started   tube feeds on  ms  was no longer tolerating her tube feeds due to very high residuals  tube feeds were stopped and she was given nutrition with d5ns at 75hr   attempted to place the dobhoff tube postpyloric but they were unable to pass the tube through the pylorus and noted contrast barely trickles through  obstruction in family meetings the family was informed that the feeding tube could not be advanced and that other options such as tpn would likely harm the pt more than help her because of her risk for bloodstream infection and metabolic derangements   metastatic anal adenocarcinoma large retroperitoneal mass compressing the abdomen and constricting the aorta at the level of the iliacs noted on ct from osh thought to be metastasis from her known anal adenocarcinoma per onc not a candidate for chemotherapy so likely not worth biopsying even though definitive diagnosis would not otherwise be reached recommend getting palliative care involved and having goals of care discussion with family  first family meeting was  and son  wanted us to do everything we could to help ms  this continued to be a theme during her hospital stay and several meetings were held with the family to discuss goals of care  on  it was decided to switch to focusing on her comfort only volume overload likely from diastolic heart failure but will need to rule out hypoalbuminemic state and cirrhosis patient with gross volume overload with 2  edema bilateral effusions and ct with anasarca on abdominal imaging  tte unchanged from previous with ef 55 and no gross valvular dysfunction tsh elevated t4 wnls patient given albumin  with good response  however patient still significantly overloaded  on  she was anuric and hypotensive despite having significant lower extremity and abdominal edema  she was transferred to the micu on this day  while in the micu she was stabilized and pressors were downtitrated  poor response to lasix alone but given lasix and chlorothiazide with good uop    hematuria unclear cause but patient was on anticoagulation concern would be primarily for tumor infiltration hematuria intermittent but seems to recur during transport potential mechanical irritation patient continues to pass dime sized clots stent exchange done  by urology with improvement in her hematuria  hematuria with clots returned on   urology recommended cbi which was started   she had cbi intermittently throughout her stay to relieve foley obstructions   normocytic anemia hgb at  86 no evidence of bleeding she does have stage iii ckd mcv within normal range and iron studies not particularly suggestive of iron deficiency anemia with ferritin of 781 folate level of 74 and b12 of 411 concern could possibly be for chronic low grade bleed from gut or hematuria transfused evening of   hgb remained stable in the 7s until  when hh dropped to   this same day she triggered for hypotension of 86doppler  as she was anuric at this  time there was concern of intraabdominal bleeding and was one of the indications for micu transfer  pt had episode of gross hematuria requiring cbi and prbc transfusion for bp control  pt required vasopressin and phenylephrine while in the micu but was able to be weaned off  she required intermittent prbc transfusions during her time in the micu  afib on coumadin chads 2 of 3 hemodynamically unstable with rvr upon arrival but controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol  she remained in afib during her hospital stay  due to her hematuria and dropping hh blood pressure medications and ultimately sqh were discontinued on    pt put on an esmolol gtt as she had afib with rvr into the 130s on her first day in the icu she was taken off the esmolol drip and thereafter controlled with iv metoprolol and

for refractory ascitesfloor coursepatient was admitted with diuretic refractory ascites he was admitted for paracenteses and evaluation for tips and future transplant the transplant team made the initial decision that the patient is not a tips or transplant candidate because of severe malnutrition and goal became to improve nutritional status and then proceedthe patients renal function began to worsen and workup was consistent with hepatorenal syndrome nephrology was consulted and agreed with hrs as the diagnosis and he was started on midodrine octreotide and daily albumin as his renal failure progressed he required dialysis and had a dialysis line placed  his worsening renal function led to the decision to expedite his transplant eligibility because he has a history of cad and is sp 2 stents from  he had to undergo a cardiac catheterization for evaluation of cad and transplant eligibility he went for cardiac cath on  which found no interventional lesions however the day after the procedure he developed a retroperitoneal bleed which led to transfer to the icumicu course shock initially secondary to hemorrhagic shock due to retroperitoneal bleed requiring massive transfusion protocol on arrival to the micu he was resuscitated though subsequently had ongoing septic shock physiology requiring pressor support etiology of septic shock was secondary to new infections including serratia uti ecoli bacteremia mssa vap despite completing a course of antibiotics vancmeropenem for all of these infections by  he had a persistent and rising leukocytosis infectious disease was consulted for assistance with workup and management micafungin was added for empiric fungal coverage his hd line placed in the setting of renal failure as below was removed pus was noted around the insertion site suggesting a line infection as a possible contributing source blood cultures however remained negative peritoneal fluid was also not suggestive of infection note is made of peritoneal fluid from  which appears inflammatory despite correction for rbc count cultures were negative however and subsequent pleural fluid did not suggest spontaneous or secondary bacterial peritonitis  alternative etiology potentially secondary to persisent gut translocation into the peritoneal space his leukocytosis downtrended without a clear source of ongoing infection  respiratory failure mr  was initially intubated in the setting of hemorrhagic shock and metabolic acidosis his course was then complicated by mssa vap after correction of metabolic acidosis he remained intubated in the setting of altered mental status volume overload and impaired lung dynamics in the setting of ascites yet despite clearing of his mental status improvement of volume status with hd and large volume paracenteses it was not possible to wean him off of the ventilator he remained intubated for more than two weeks with a likely contribution from respiratory muscle weakness in the setting of prolonged intubation he had ongoing thick secretions requiring repeated bronchoscopies for clearance of mucous plugging and lll collapse tracheostomy was discussed with the patient and family the patient clearly indicated that he did not want a tracheostomy nor did he want to remain intubated rather he made it clear that he wanted to be extubated to comfort care he was extubated on the evening of  and passed within a few hours family was at bedside  renal failure mr  was noted to have progressively worsening renal function prior to micu transfer consistent with hepatorenal syndrome he was started on midodrine and octreotide as well as albumin his renal failure progressed requiring dialysis and a dialysis line was placed  he continued on cvvh while in the icu and was ultimately transitioned to intermittent hd his hd line was removed as noted above in the setting of persistent leukocytosis for a line holiday a temporary line was replaced given ongoing dialysis needs he required pressors in the icu in order to tolerate fluid removal with hd    mssa pneumonia noted to have mssa pneumonia from sputum culture on  he was initially treated with vancomycin pending sensitivities however he was continued on vancomycin despite penicillin sensitivity in order to prevent inducible serratia resistance in the setting of serratia uti as below he completed a course of antibiotics on  though antibiotics were continued as noted above in the setting of ongoing leukocytosis  ecoli bacteremia ecoli noted on blood culture on  he was initially treated with meropenem for gnr bacteremia and completed a 2 week course of meropenem on  though antibiotics were continued in the setting of persistent leukocytosis as above and concern for ongoing gut translocation  serratia uti noted on urine culture on  he was treated with a course of meropenem atrial flutterfib micu course was complicated by recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter this initially occurred in the setting of volume removal with cvvh and responded well to doses of metoprolol or diltiazem he developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension requiring pressors later in his icu course during bronchoscopy requiring amiodarone he was continued on amiodarone until his he was transitioned to comfort measures  ileus mr  malnutrition was noted while he was on the floor and prior to micu transfer after intubation an ngt was placed and tube feeds were initiated he had high residuals that precluded goal tube feeding ct ap did not reveal obstructive pathology concern for potential peritonitis causing ileus though ileus persisted despite negative peritoneal cultures ileus did not improve with reglan he was started on tpn a dophoff was placed advanced postpyloric by   decompensated cirrhosis mr  had worsening liver failure with rising bilirubin and meld score throughout his hospital stay in the setting of multiple complications as noted below also with renal failure requiring hd micu team and liver attending had ongoing family meetings regarding potential for liverkidney transplant as his hospital course progressed it became increasingly clear that he would not recover to be well enough

hospitalization course is as follows t12 lesion patient has profound lower extremity weakness bilaterally some of which is baseline from her previous cva her right sided neuro exam is notable for hyperreflexia and clonus which is likely left over from her distant stroke she was continued on dexamethasone and iss while on the high dose steroids  the patient was also given a tlso brace for ambulation although initially in too much pain to ambulate and the head of her bed was kept at 45 degrees  she received a preop myelogram consistent with an expanding t12 lesion from prior imaging  she was subsequently taken for decompression surgery by orthospine team sp t10l2 fusion t12 corpectomy and transferred to the orthospine service for postop management for two days  when she returned

neuroonc the patient was transitioned from dexamethasone 10mg q8 hours to dexamethasone 4mg bid on pod4  she was transferred to the neurology service for better management of her leg weakness  it was felt this was likely due to postop pain and inability for her to express her pain level due to her aphasia  her medications were titrated and she did better on a higher dose fentanyl patch with immediate release morphine and tylenol for breaththrough pain  subsequently her leg movements improved on better pain control  she will require xrt for her other bony lesions and will need to follow

involving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx with extension to the fifth mtp joint  this was consistent with repeat imaging at   her l foot and ankles were also imaged because the pt was complaining of additional pain however films did not reveal any additional acute fractures  the feet were vascularly intact  orthopedics recommended a hard sole boot for when the patient became ambulatory otherwise no intervention necessary  pain patient was found in extreme pain when transfered back to medicine service on pod2  unclear of origin as patient has difficulty communicating due to her aphasia patients pain was controlled with standing acetaminophen oxycodone oxycontin fentanyl patch and dilaudid iv prn  the pain team was also consulted to help manage her pain  she was able to come off the oxycontin on a higher dose of fentanyl patch and had po  oxycodone and tylenol for break through pain encephalopathy on pod2 there was noted an increase in aphasia and confusion which was difficult to assess given baseline communication issues hchct for acute bleed was negative the pt was afebrile and infectious workup including ua was neg urine ctx and blood ctx were negaitve for

characteristics are typical of simple fluid rather than hemorrhage  her hct remained stable and the ultimate source of her hct drop was never identified but felt to be possibly due to postop hemolysis  the fluid collection was discussed with ortho spine service who felt it could be conservatively watched for now likely just postsurgical changes history of stroke the patient was continued on home

cannabis use disorder severe who drove down from  with concerns for being chased and in an attempt to flee the zombie apocalypse per collateral he has been showing signs of paranoia and disorganization for the last few weeks tomonths psychosis nos vs substance induced psychosis when mr  was first admitted to our inpatient psychiatry unit at  he described fleeing from the zombie apocalypse in  and raised concerns that others had been judging him onhis abilities he had been using marijuana heavily and felt that it was palliative for him in addressing his anxiety  notably he has no history of true psychosis yet had been exhibiting symptoms such as isolation paranoia and delusional thought content significant for concerns that there were camerasimplanted in his house initially he was very difficult to meet with as he perseverated almost exclusively on medications that he needed from the treatment team for a variety of medical and psychiatric complaints see below he spoke to the team in metaphors and would answer with bizarre statements we performed a pretty thorough medical workup including a ct head negative unremarkable cbc and bmp normal lft panel normal tsh hgba1c 55 normal cortisol level and low testosterone likely due to years of testosterone injections impacting the natural hpa axis and a heavy metal screen that was ultimately clotted and not repeated no longer thought to be relevant we attempted to attain neuropsychological testing but mr  had difficulty participating and was reluctant to answer certain questions because he felt the answers werent right for him or had difficulty navigating the different answer choices we started mr  on risperidone and uptitrated it to a total of 6mg qhs which he tolerated well and showed good effect we also discontinued many of his somatic treatments that did not provide clear indications such as testosterone and selegiline with concern that polypharmacy was impacting his mental status we also tapered him off of his benzodiazapines off of his many home medications and without cannabis his mental status improved with the additional benefit of risperidone by the time of discharge he was far more focused linear and goal oriented he no longer had any of the bizarre thought content he had on admission and he was able to openly discuss his relationship concerns as his marriage dissolved during this hospitalization he was able to utilize coping strategies for anxiety as well as very low dose hydroxyzine his medications should be monitored and evaluated in the outpatient setting based on his presentation once he is in the community somatization disorder severe mr  has a long history of undergoing numerous procedures and starting a variety of medications that have unclear indications he has initiated and discontinued his healthcare based on his perception of the medications he believes he needs while on the inpatinet psychiatry unit he presented the team with a list of medications he desired on a daily basis despite many conversations about how they likely impacted his mental status  he was very somatically preoccupied though this did lessen over time early during his hospital course he required very frequent reassurance and address of his anxiety symptoms he would complain of chest pain shortness of breath thumb pain etc frequently as the hospitalization progressed his complaints were far fewer we asked his wife to bring up his medications at home so we could see what he had actually been taking and had access to she brought a very large box of medications which included depot testosteroneibuprofen x2 bottlestamsulosinfurosemide x2 bottlespropranololepi penacetaminophenclonazepamfish oilnystatin cream x5 tubesvoltaren geldexomethasone creamselegine patchestriple antibiotic ointmentclotrimazole creamfiber therapypolyethylene glycolaspirinketorolacomega 3 fatty acidsmultiple ipratroprium inhalersmultiple albuterol inhalerslevothyroxineandrogelnatural tearswe discussed the somatization disorder with mr  which he had difficulty in understanding and accepting we discussed how his pursuit of excessive healthcare has been detrimental to his mental status and he voiced not wanting to do this in the future though continued to request different medications from the team we called his pharmacy in  and canceled all refills of outstanding medications we also disposed of all of the medications listed above it will be very important for mr  to continue to be engaged with outpatient treatment but it will be equally important for him to not continue doctor shopping and procuring multiple medications from different providers that are not indicated on discharge mood was good mse was pertinent for an obese caucasian man wearing casual clothes and demonstrating appropriate hygiene and grooming he was cooperative engaged and pleasant he reported his mood was good and his affect was mood congruent though slightly anxious his thoughts were mostly linear though there still was evidence of some over inclusion of details and circumstantiality his thought content was devoid of any delusional thoughts paranoia auditory or visual hallucinations or any of the bizarre thoughts he displayed on admission he denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation intent or plan he was hyperverbal but not pressured and had a regular rhythm and prosody to his speech his judgment and insight improved since admissionsafety the  remained in good behavioral control throughout this hospitalization and did not require physical or chemical restraint the  remained on 15 minute checks which is our lowest acuity level of checksgeneral medical conditionsnote please see section above for more information about somatization disorder the treatment team felt that the  had been seeking consultation and medications from many different providers and was requesting medications from these providers that were not necessarily medically indicated and in combination together harmful we discontinued all of the medications except for those listed in discharge medications and called his  pharmacy in  and canceled remaining refills he did well off of these medications and he should follow up with his outpatient pcp for further management if issues arise htn treated with losartan 50mg daily following consultation with our medicine service which resulted in mostly normotensive blood pressure readings we discontinued his home beta blocker due to concerns for worsening of depressive symptoms follow up bmp was within normal limits following initiation of this medication he will be discharged with a prescription for losartan  hypothyroidism during admission tsh was checked and found to be within normal limits we continued his 112mcg levothyroxine and provided him with a prescription for this on discharge we previously discontinued all refills at his regular pharmacy he should continue follow up with his pcp for further management  poison  mr  developed a dermatological reaction to reactivated poison  that he sustained prior to admission characterized by fluid filled bullae he was evaluated by the dermatology service who lanced and dressed his lower extremity wounds and started him on clobetasol ointment which he is to continue for three weeks total course he should be reevaluated at the end of  if he still has remaining pruritis or erythema and needs further treatment he utilized his hydroxyzine to help with his pruritispsychosocial milieugroupsthe  was highly animated euthymic and

they have probably met together no more than four times  came to dr  treatment resistant depression they have had trouble developing a working alliance because he has specific and rigid ideas of what he wants he believes he does have aspergers he has a lot of physical complaints and has had real physical issues the real physical issues has spiraled into a series of somatic complaints there is a lot that bothers him about his body which is exacerbated by the stress he experiences in his life he has been loathe to come in for appointments but calls a lot he has a lot of specialists involved in his care and feels overwhelmed but feels unsatisfied that no one can figure out what is going on he has been using medicinal marijuana and has wanted dr  to approve of this dr  if his presentation is due to use of medicinal marijuana he says he is very suggestible he notes that the way  he describes side effects the time courses dont always line uphe had a therapist at one point who really validated him and he got better when he first saw dr  was taking a lot of supplements most of which were psychoactively neutral dr is concerned that he could be taking other supplements that might be psychoactivelegal statusthe  signed a cv and during his hospitalization signed a 3day notice the treatment team filed a section  due to concerns for his inability to care for himself in the community

solving conflict resolution and handling problems in a nonviolent wayhistory of employment and educationcurrent housing optionscurrent risk is low for intentional selfharm given that mr  denies

with this   we discussed the  right to decide whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the  actively participating in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications with the treatment team and i answered the  questions  the  appeared able to understand and consented to begin the medicationprognosisguarded mr  has a longstanding history of somatization disorder acquiring a variety of somatic and psychiatric treatments that do not have clear indications and have been detrimental to his health when he presented to  he was disorganized exhibited bizarre thinking and showed symptoms concerning for psychosis likely attributed to a combination of cannabis and many prescription medications after the treatment team discontinued most of his medications and he was sober from the cannabis he was able to think clearer became more calm and was able to relate to others better while his thought process was clear and organized on the day of discharge there is concern that mr  could display these aforementioned psychotic symptoms again in the future in the face of overmedication or selfmedication with cannabis he is aware of his diagnosis of somatization disorder and if he is able to not pursue unnecessary medical treatments and stop using cannabis entirely and continue care with his psychiatrist he can definitely achieve a much better prognosis,past

paracentesis site had dramatically decreased and by the time she reached the floor on the morning of  the drainage had entirely stopped with only scant yellow drainage appreciable on the gauze padding despite the cessation in drainage and quiescent appearance of paracentesis site wo erythema or induration or purulence given the potential for clinically silent sbp she underwent  assessment for

exertion worsening skin rash and hypereosinophiliaeosinophilia on presentation she was noted to have wbc 209 with substantial hypereosinophilia eos 51  and absolute eos 1066 she previously had an extensive work up for the cause of her eosinophilia infectious hematalogic oncologic rheumatologic allergic which was largely negative except for a positive strongyloides for which she was treated with ivermectin prior to this admission without resolution of her symptoms this was ultimately thought to be a falsepositive result based on the fact that she actually had no exposure history she was noted to have eosinophilic lung and skin infiltrates as well as tcell polyclonal predominance on bm tumor lysis labs k ldh uric acid transaminases and a peripheral smear were sent  for concern for acute malignant transformation leading to the profound eosinophilia but were not consistent with an acute transformation she was followed by several teams including hemeonc pulm derm and cards it was felt that her hypereosinophilia was likely due to a secondary lymphocyticpredominant hypereosinophilic syndrome for which the treatment is steriods she was started on prednisone 40mg with rapid steady drop in wbc and eos  the prednisone was increased to 60mg  when the eos was noted to have plateaued at 10 on 40mg she was discharged on prednisone 60mg with the plan to taper after eos 5 in the outpatient setting she was discharged with close allergy and pulmonology followup shortness of breath on presentation to the ed she was afebrile and satting 89 ra labs were notable for a wbc 209 with 50 eos absolute eos 1066bnp 14000 she was also noted to have crackles and wheezing on exam pulmonary edema was noted on chest xray he sob was thus thought to likely be due to her copd as well as an acute dchf exacerbation she received nebulizers and iv diuresis lasix with minimal improvement in her sob tte to evaluate cardiac function showed lvef 75 as well as new lvot obstruction thought to contribute minimally to her symptoms given her history of markedly elevated eosinophil count and extensive work up as above eosinophiliadriven dyspnea was considered she had a lung biopsy on a previous admission which showed eosinophilic infiltrate but no evidence of granulomas she was also noted to be anca negative cardiac mri showed no evidence of eosinophilia infiltration or myocarditis prednisone for copd was initially held for fear of worsening her respiratory status in the setting of strongyloides however given she had been treated for strongyloides and that this diagnosis was much les likely she was started on prednisone continued diuresis and nebulizers did not improve her symptoms substantially several teams were consulted including pulmonology dermatology and cardiology but the etiology of the respiratory shortness of breath remained unclear after considerable deliberation the consensus was that she likely had a lymphocyticvariant of hypereosinophilia syndrome and she was started on prednisone 40mg with significant improvement in her respiratory symptoms along with her copd meds and gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg po qd to maintain an even total body water balance and stable daily weights the dose of prednisone was increased to 60mg just prior to discharge due to a plateau as above she was slowly weaned from 5l of supplemental o2 and discharged on 1l o2  on ckd she was noted to have a cr on 15 on presentation from a baseline of 11  s k of 54 it was initially thought to be due to chf exacerbation vs eosinophilia related malignant proliferation vs direct damage tumor lysis labs were mildly elevated but not suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome as the cause of the renal injury she recieved iv diuresis without improvement nephrology was consulted and determined that  was most likely due to  in the setting of agressive diuresis and exposure to contrast given recent ct with contrast urine analysis was bland and not suggestive of eosinophil driven nephropathy creatinine returned to baseline with reduction of iv diuresis discharge creatinine was 13 rash appearance consistent with a drug rash but extensive allergy testing done prior and lack of new recent exposures made this less likely skin lesion biopsied which showed superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils and focal spongiosis suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction to systemic antigen  thought to be related to hypereosinophilia syndrome improved with initiation of oral and topical steriods also treated with cetirizine low dose gabapentin and several antihistamineshyperkalemia noted to have elevated k of 54 on admission improved as renal function improved as stated above noted to be again elevated at 63 despite recovered renal function unclear etiology but likely dietary she states that she had been ingesting k rich foods tomato soups melons etc no sign of hemolysis on blood smear or highly metabolis states associated with rapid turnover medications not likely contributory she had an ekg at the time which was normal got lasix 40mg iv and kayexalate 30mg with recheck that showed k 5 switched to low k diet after which k downtrended and remained stable for the remainder of stay  hypertension treated with amlodipine 10 mg and furosemide 40mg po qd permissive hypertension was allowed given new lvot obstruction she will be somewhat preload and afterload dependent and care should be taken not to reduce either of these parameters substantially history of seizures continued on home lamotrigine levetiracetam phenobarbital phenytoin sodium levels were checked after starting prednisone to ensure therapeutic levels  full codetransitional issues will need a repeat ige spirometry and lung volumes to assess response to treatment in

worsening lvot as a possible etiology avoid over diuresis as well as aggressive preloadafterload reduction hyperkalemia resolved with low k diet she should continue with a low k diet discharged on

acidosis as transfer from   reportedly at the osh her ecg was concerning for possible atrial fibrillation w complete heart block and both atropine and transcutaneous pacing were attempted prior to transfer of note on arrival to  she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation w slow ventricular response and rates  sequence of causality is unclear ie if patient was bradycardic leading to decreased renal perfusion and thus an acidosis or if patient was acidotic due to renal failure or other cause leading to bradycardia however given lack of other end organ damage more likely the latter her troponins were negative so unlikely to be ischemic in etiology she is on high doses of metoprolol and diltiazem at home and denies taking more medications than prescribed on arrival the pt was briefly on a dopamine drip in this setting her metoprolol and dilitiazem were held and her metoprolol was slowly reintroduced her bradycardia resolved pulmonary hypertension the patient had evidence of volume

outpatient followup should involve a local pulmonologist at  and ph specialist at  she has had relatively extensive pulmonary hypertension workup however still needs pfts we have scheduled an appointment for her on  at  with a pulmonary hypertension specialist  recommend referral to a cardiologist given her bradycardia with heart block on admission and further titration of nodal blockers

disorder sp numerouspsychiatric hospitalizations currently a  client who initially presented to  ed via ems complaining of a sore throat and a headache who was subsequently admitted to  on a  due to concerns for decompensated psychosiswith periods of agitation paranoia somatic delusions in the setting of medication noncompliance  interview with mr  was limited and he essentially denied all psychotic symptoms however review of the medical record reveals a longstanding history of severe mental illness with his first psychiatric hospitalization at age  and numerous subsequent hospitalizations for mania and psychosis mental status on my examination is notable for a young man with adequate hygiene and grooming who appears paranoid at times but with adequate eye contact flattened prosody of speechfine mood with blunted affect and somewhat disorganized thought process limited insight and judgment cognitive examination is notable for concrete thought process discharge mental status exam is unchanged  diagnostically differential diagnosis includes schizophrenia with affective features vs bpad with persistent cognitive deficits of note it seems clear that his ongoing cannabis use is contributing to his current presentation although im not clear how much or how often mr  is using marijuana regardless of diagnosis given concerns for his ability to care for self he met  criteria for inpatient admission for evaluation of medications discharge and safety planning   legalsafety patient admitted to  on a upon admission he declined to sign a conditional voluntary form until the expiration of his 3 day notice on  of note he maintained his safety throughout his psychiatric hospitalization on 15 minute checks and did not require physical or chemical restraints  psychosis as noted above with history of mania concerning for bipolar disorder vs schizoaffective disorder  patient was compliant in attending groups and although he was somewhat irritable at times on the unit he maintained adequate behavioral control during his admission  patient declined medical workup including ekg and metabolic workup lfts  we discussed the risks and benefits of antipsychotic medication including zyprexa which he consistently declined throughout his hospitalization collateral was obtained from his mother and father who stated that mr  had been off his medications for a number of months now but without unsafe behaviors however they did note he had appeared more stressed following the knowledge that his grandfather had passed away in  the parents had no safety concerns with the patient being discharged the patient was amenable to having his  caseworker   meet with him on the unit and mr  agreed to follow up with mr  following discharge  of note a considerable amount of time was spent during this hospitalization discussing the risks and benefits of antipsychotic medications and i was clear with mr  that i believed he could benefit strongly from medication he stated he would continue to think about it and seemed amenable to following up with an outpatient psychiatrist and therapist once discharged he consistently denied suicidal ideation thoughts of self harm hi thoughts of wanting to harm others during his hospitalization and appeared to be able to care for himself without difficulty with good hygiene and grooming therefore given his strong preference to be discharged he was discharged shortly after the expiration of his  of note he was amenable to signing a cv form as we discussed that another day was needed in order to set up appropriate follow up   cannabis use disorder discussed the pros and cons of marijuana use andencouraged abstinence encouraged patient to participate in aana and he was in agreement with continuing to not use cannabis  headaches as noted in hpi  patient was continued on motrin and tylenol and strongly advised not to take excessive amounts of these pain killers due to the risk of damage to his liver

euthymic in his mood but annoyed with hospitalization he was clearly future oriented and without suicidal ideation plan or intent he stated that he no longer saw the point in suicide as he would not want to hurt his mom and he did not see suicide as something that would end his life but it would be something to hurt another he feels that he would rather be a thorn to somebody than take his life

prognosis was somewhat guarded but may improve in time as his coumadin had to be discontinued the patient had an ivc filter placed while admitted  2 arrhthymias the patient had several episodes of atrial tachycardia while on telemetry as well as one episode of bradycardia this was likely atrial fibrillation secondary to the stress of acute event cardiology was consulted and recommended a lowdose beta blocker for rate control metoprolol 125mg three times  tsh was normal the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission with normal blood pressure cardiology was also concerned that additional antiarrythmic intervention would increase his risk for bradycardia of which the patient had only one concerning episode but which would ultimately likely be more problematic than his wellperfusing tachycardia if the patient decompensates in the future a pacemaker could be considered as a palliative measure if life expectancy sufficient     3 lung cancer per report of

subsequent pneumoniahowever the patient remained stable from a respiratory standpoint throughout his hospitalization with 02 saturations 95 on room air and without respiratory distress in the future if the patient develops respiratory distress intervention on the bronchial mass could be considered by interventional pulmonology with stenting or phototherapy  these procedures would require intubation with bronchoscopy  the patient with follow up with ip as an outpatient  4 fever the patient became febrile on the floor spiking fevers of up to 1013  on multiple occasions  although he had

necrotizing pancreatitis etiology of the patients pancreatitis was not clear ct imaging revealed a partiallynecrosed pancreas with a fluid collection there was no history of significant etoh use triglycerides were wnl he had not had a recent ercp or steroid use and there was no evidence of gallstones on imaging his  score was calculated to be 7 he received aggressive fluid resuscitation and was started on iv meropenem given his very significant resuscitation requirements the patient was intubated to maintain oxygenation and ventilation in the setting of worsening anasarca and thirdspacing of fluid surgery did not feel that his presentation warranted operative management the patient initially began to show interval improvement after the first 48 hours as measured by lab abnormalities and fluid resuscitaton requirements but then again decompensated with fevers  103 a precipitous rise in wbc a diffuse rash and hypotension requiring more aggressive fluid resuscitation and eventual initiation of vasopressors repeat imaging showed no evidence of progression of necrotic pancreas or other any intraabdominal process the patient was empirically switched to aztreonamflagyl given concern for a druginduced reaction see below the patient was followed with serial ct scans of his pancreas which ultimately showed extensive pancreatic necrosis he was maintained on tpn until he was able to tolerate enteric feeding his clinical course was complicated by development of an ileus his ileus was followed with serial kubs and eventually improved due to significant difficulty placing a postpyloric feeding tube he had an ng tube placed and was started on tube feeds which he tolerated he had a postpyloric feeding tube placed on  and tube feeds were continued at the time of discharge he was tolerating tube feeds well and did not require tpn  2 respiratory distress his respiratory failure was secondary to lll collapse and pulmonary edema and increased abdominal distension from ileus and anascarca requiring peep initially as high as 18 likely secondary to increased intrabdominal pressure when blood pressue was stable and he was able to be diuresed he began to require less positive pressure dead space measurement did not reveal a significant amount of dead space present and he was able to increasingly tolerate pressure support ultimately he underwent trach placement he was transitioned to trach mask ventilation and had a passymuir valve placed of note on the afternoon after having the sutures removed from his tracheostomy site the patients trach tube was noted to be out of proper position anesthesia and ct surgery urgently evaluated the patient he was transiently intubated and his trach was replaced at the bedside the patient did not have any further problems with his tracheostomy as he approached discharge the patient remained grossly fluid overloaded diuresis with iv lasix should be continued with a goal of  l negative a day at the time of discharge he is slighly positive for length of stay  he will require further weaning from the trach mask3 bacteremia fevers  as above he was initially started on meropenem on admission for severe pancreatitis  the meropenum was transitioned to aztreonam after he developed skin changes concerning for an allergic reaction he continued to spike daily fevers which were felt to possibly be related to his pancreatitis but also possibly related to an underlying infection eventually he grew coag neg staph sensitive to linezolid in consecutive blood cultures from  and then coag neg staph that was resistant to linezolid in a blood culture on  additionally he grew pansensitive enterococcus faecalis in consecutive blood cultures from  his central venous lines were the suspected source however his diffuse skin breakdown in the setting of his allergic reaction was also thought to be a possible source of his staph he underwent multiple cvl changes given these positive cultures tee negative for vegetations or abscesses also he grew acinetobacter from a right ij blood cx on  and from multiple sputum cultures given his various positive cultures he was followed by the infectious disease service who recommended various adjustments to his antibiotic regimen he was unable to be started on vancomycin because of a questionable history allergy reported from another facility  allergy was consulted and felt that he is unlikely to be allergic to vancomycin however to be safe he should undergo a desensitization if vancomycin was necessary  he was placed on aztreonam amikacin and linezolid however aztreonam was ultimately stopped as it appeared that the acinetobacter was not susceptible he was tried on tigecycline but developed a questionable allergic reaction at the time of discharge the infectious disease team recommended a total 14 day course of amikacin to end on   3 skin rash as above the patient was initially started on meropenem on admission however he thereafter developed a clinical decompensation including a diffuse rash this rash consisted of significant erythema and desquamation and ultimately covered a significant portion of the patients upper and lower extremities as well as his trunk when he developed this rash he was empirically switched to aztreonamflagyl given concern for a druginduced reaction ie dress syndrome  dermatology was consulted and agreed that the rash likely represented a drug reaction but felt that the likely inciting agent was unasyn approximately two weeks prior to rash development biopsies were performed and were also consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction later in his hospital course the patient was started on tigecycline after which he was noted to develop a new papular rash concerning for an allergy the tigecycline was promptly discontinued allergy and immunology was consulted to comment on patients multiple skin reactions to various antibiotics and it was thought the culprit was tigecycline since it correlated to his time course however if tigecycline would be needed in the future the patient could undergo desensitization pts skin rash improved throughout hospital course and he was seen multiple times by the wound care team who left excellent recommendations for care which was transcribed into his discharge paperwork for continuation at rehab 4 abdominal distention ileus  the  hospital course was complicated by a prolonged ileus there was some initial concern for cdiff and he was kept on flagyl for an extended period of time given the impossibility of collecting stool samples  however stool samples were eventually negative for c diff  his ileus was followed by serial kubs after several unsuccessful attempts at placement of a postpyloric feeding tube he was started on gastric tube feedings he subsequently developed marked abdominal distention and tube feeds were held  his ileus improved after weaning narcotics and a few doses of methylnaltrexone after the patients ileus improved he was restarted on tube feeds and tolerated them well5 agitation delerium given his intubation the patient was initially on large amounts of iv sedation after tracheostomy placement the patients sedation was weaned in the setting of weaning his sedation he began to experience some agitation and delirium for which he was started on standing methadone and haldol as these medications were tapered he was started on standing seroquel at time of discharge pt was aox3 at his baseline and had good insight into his condition 6 distributive shock his pancreatitis was complicated by hypotension ultimately requiring pressors the etiology was likely multifactoiral including his pancreatitis his bacteremia and his sedation while he was intubated as his clinical status improved and his sedation was weaned his hypotension improved and his pressors were weaned and stopped 7 acute kidney injury the patient presented with acute renal failure which initially improved with iv hydration his hospital course was complicated by some additional elevations in his creatining generally in the setting of ct scans at the time of discharge his creatinine was stable and within normal limits8 anemia patients hematocrit slowely trended down during his hospitalization ng tube contents and stool were both guaiac negative and felt to be secondary to repeated phelbotomy his hematocrit was trended and he was transfused prn to maintain a hct above 21 his blood counts had been stable for several days prior to discharge9 type ii diabetes cb neuropathy the patient was continued on sliding scale insulin and was given insulin in his tpn  following transfer from tpn  to tube feeds he required lantus and an insulin sliding scale with meals due to high blood sugars

started started on cefepime amikacin was then discontinued and a regimen of daptomycincefepimemetronidazolefluconazole was continued for about 3 weeks until the patient began to stabilize and cultures were negative at which point fluconazole was discontinued followed by metronidazole followed by daptomycin and finally cefepime other than a gram negative species that grew out of the left pseudocyst in late  and the entrococcus species already mentioned which was thought to likely be a contaminant by id all other cultures were negative including cultures of catheter tips and ascitic fluid leukocytosis showed a general trend toward improvement with intermittent lability as did the patients temperature cultures taken at the time of spikes were repeatedly negative the etiology of the spikes remained unclear but it was hypothesized that inflammatory mediators from a sterile cyst could be triggering febrile episodes it could also not be ruled out that the untapped midline cyst may be infected and transiently seeding the blood drug reaction in particulary to cefepime and lasix was also considered pancreatic pseudocysts  successfully placed a catheter in the patients lateral pseudocyst culture data as above serial imaging showed some slight decrease in size in the cyst but no significant change the midline cyst was not amenable to  drainage gi consult was obtained for endoscopic drainage but intervention was deferred given the potential risks and complications in an otherwise critical patient general surgery was also consulted for the duration of the hospitalization surgery was deferred and the recommendation was made to continue the drains until followup with outpatient general surgery  weeks after discharge to rehab but upon repeat ct imaging immediately prior to discharge the recommendation was made to pull the lateral pancreatic cyst in light of it being smaller in size and to continue the llq ascitic drain the llq drain was subsequently discontinued prior to discharge the patient was scheduled for a repeat ct and followup with dr  in late  prior to discharge he was also scheduled for a followup with dr   respiratory failure  tracheostomy intubated at an outside hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure cmvac was maintained and titrated to abgs per the usual icu protocol in conjunction with appropriate iv sedation given the patients anticipated protracted ventilator dependence and difficult weaning course the decision was made to place a tracheostomy which was performed by thoracic surgery without complication circa  as dated by his thoracic surgery preop note the cuff initially leaked intermittently but after minor repositioning at the bedside functioned appropriately without further issues the patient was progressively weaned to ps and ventilator mask as tolerated as his respiratory status improved in conjunction with his overall clinical improvement as a result of the interventions detailed above prior to discharge he was breathing comfortably on trach mask 24 hours a day he had an episode of delerium late in his hospitalization the weekend prior to discharge which resulted in him pulling out his tracheostomy but it was replaced without complication at the bedside and he subsequently had no further episodes speach and swallow consulted late in the hospitalization to fit a passymuir valve but was unsuccessful and it was thought that this was due to the transient inflammation caused by the aforementioned episode of removing and replacing his tracheostomy of note he was phonating the day of discharge without the passymuir valve he will likely benefit from downsizing of his cuff once in rehab left sided pleural effusion noted early in the hospitalization that the patient had a left sided pleural effusion this effusion was not tapped in the setting acute instability and subsequently managed conservatively without tapping as the patient stabilized from a respiratory perspective with the hypothesis that it would progressively shrink with diuresis the etiology was thought to be transdiaphagramatic ascites anasarca  volume overload iatrogoenic from fluid resuscitation and steadily improved with lasix gtt followed by lasix bolus iv which was then transitioned to po in conjunction with the patients autodiuresis diuresis was titrated to remain within the patients hemodynamic limits during the period of labile hypotensive episodes and then titrated to cr when the patient was more hemodynamically unstable on discharge he was negative 21 liters from admission and 96kg from 128kg on admission in the days prior to discharge was transitioned from lasix to po torsemide which was titrated to 30mg daily ascites paracentesis fluid consistent with exudative process likely due to necrotizing pancreatitis underwent paracentesis with drain placement the drain was discontinued prior to discharge and the patient was scheduled for followup with dr  hypotensive episodes labile blood pressures part 1 of 2 multifactorial initially due in large part to septic physiology but also complicated by a borderline abdominalcompartment syndrome in the setting of pancreatitis hypotension was responsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation and source control in conjunction with pressors but sbp remained labile into the  until the abdomen became less tense with peak bladder pressures ranging in the  abdominal compartment syndrome resolved with paracentesis and drain placement as well as diuresis in turn hypotensive episodes also resolved hypertensive episodes labile blood pressures part 2 of 2 coincident with hypotensive episodes also had hypertensive episodes especially in the setting of agitation agitation was addressed with iv sedatives in the early interval of the hospitalization and antipsychotics as detailed below in the latter interval hypertensive medications were started and titrated to address the hypertensive spikes  metoprolol and enalaprilat  in conjunction with prn labetalol and hydralazine once the hypertensive episodes were less frequent and lower in amplitude peaking into the 190s at times the patient was transitioned onto a metoprolol 75 tid and enalaprilat was discontinued metoprolol was discontinued  because it was suspected as a cause of his eosinophilia sinus tachycardia rate controlled with metoprolol as described above which was then discontinued because it was suspected to be causing his eosinophilia metoprolol was discontinued and diltiazem was started then titrated to 120 mg pong qid dm2  hyperglycemia blood sugars were controlled with an iss and when running tpn insulin to keep bs 150 patient was started on a low dose of glargine after tpn was dced as blood sugars ran above 200 with the tube feeds glargine was titrated up to 45 u qhs prior to discharge agitationdelirium once sedation was weaned the patient had intermittent episodes of agitation and delerium which were treated with zyprexa 5 qam  10mg qpm and prn haldol this regimen was discontinued late in the hospitalization because it was thought to not be helping the patients underlying problem which was insomnia prior to discharge he was

placement then removal for questionable empyema who continues to recuperate on iv antibiotics without any additional thoracic procedures please see below for more detailed hospitalization summary shortness of breath effusions healthcare associated pna mr  has longstanding copd at baseline and requires home o2 25l nasal cannula he arrived to osh with notable dyspnea worse from typical baseline this was initially attributed to possible diastolic chf exacerbation in setting of poorly controlled atrial fibrillation he was given generous amounts of iv lasix at  but continued to have some worse shortness of breath cxr showed bilateral effusions however review of older images shows these are chronic fairly stable effusions and seem a less likely cause for acute worsened dyspnea given elevated wbc to peak 22k recent malaise poor po intake and shortness of breath there was clinical suspicion for underlying pna with worse local inflammatoryirritation and copd flare up as patient with very poor pulmonary reserve the differential also includes possible underlying malignancy given his declining state x months prominent smoking history and and note of pleural thickening on recent ct chest in terms of chf recent bnp in 1000s range ho mainly diastolic chf with ef 55 on tte just days ago after concern for possible underlying complicated loculated effusion with ct chest questioning empyema patient underwent right sided chest tube placement at outside hospital but no pleural fluid able to be collected he was then transferred to  icu service with urgent thoracic surgery consult thoracic surgery team felt patient had very minimal effusions on imaging and did not feel ct chest imaging constituted a true empyema picture thus thoracic surgery felt a repeat attempt at thoracentesis or any other invasive procedures like  guided pigtail drain placement or vatsdecortication would only be of minimal or no benefit given very small amount of pleural fluid which was felt to be chronic as patient has had similar fluid at lung bases in previous imaging chest tube was removed in sicu and patient transferred to medical service where he was continued on plan for 8 days continued broad coverage for hospital acquired pna with iv vancomycin and zosyn blood cultures with no growth also continued patient on prn nebulizers advair inhaler spiriva chest physical therapy routine and he was eventually weaned down to usual home 2l o2 nasal cannula at time of discharge he had no fevers wbcs in normal range and no complaints of cough or shortness of breath  leukocytosis trend with initial rise from  admission and then resolved after  days of being on iv vancomycinzosyn therapy wbc trend 10 22 1910 8 prior to discharge remained afebrile after his transfer to medicine service on  most probable source was underlying pna although there was some initial concern for uti as his urine grew out coag negative staphylococcus  only at osh however a repeat urinalysis and urine culture collected  showed no significant evidence for any uti moreover patient had no complaints of dysuria urgency or frequency he had some mild tenderness over his abdominal midline and left side but he stated this was chronic and due to history of ventral hernia he had no concerning abdominal cramps nausea or emesis prior to discharge he did have a few loose stools which were felt to be a side effect of his antibiotics  as above plan is to continue broad iv abx with zosynvancomycin for hap up until  for full 8 day course   right  dvt mild edema was noted on the right lower extremity imaging with ultrasound demonstrated a mixed picture of possible mixture of both some newerolder thrombi patient very immobile at baseline which increases his risk he was started on weight based iv heparin gtt with close ptt monitoring and started on daily oral coumadin with plan for at least 3 months of therapy  his heparin was stopped on  when his inr rose to 23 on 4mg of coumadin on the evening of  he got 2mg of coumadin  his inr the morning of discharge was 51 goal inr  and his coumadin is being held his inr should be followed daily and coumadin restarted at 1 mg once his inr is 3 he will need 3 months of coumadin treatment for his dvt he should discuss with his pcp whether he needs to stay on coumadin longer for his a fib he has no significant gi bleeding in past but he is a slight fall risk at this time which makes longer term anticoagulation decision making more challenging as risksbenefits need to be discussed further atrial fibrillation currently rate controlled with hrs  100s range at home had been on po diltiazem regimen and needed placement on dilt drip digoxin and additional metoprolol while at  he was transitioned to once daily toprol xl 150 mg the morning of discharge he did have one episode of emesis and a single dose of metoprolol tartrate 25mg was given as it is unclear whether he vomited his am xl dose his metoprolol dose will likely need to be further uptitrated for tighter hr control he had a chads score of 3 and a concomitant diagnosis of rle dvt and is on coumadin currently with supratherapeutic inr as above his worsing a fib could have been due to hypovolemia volume shifts vs infection as outlined above he was ruled out for acute cardiac syndromes with biomarkers at osh digoxin was stopped early on in his admission and no additional diltiazem  was used as he did very well on metoprolol po tid which was transitioned to toprol xl as abovearf baseline is near 0910 range and peaked up to cr 21 range on  his creatinine was 09 on the day pf discharge causes include recent contrast exposure with ct studies prerenal causes in setting of osh lasix dosing feurea 35 and urine electrolyte profile favored prerenal causes renal dysfunction from antibioticsain was also considered but he only had a very scant amount of eosinophils in urine making this less probable  vancomycin was renally dosed and troughs monitored his vanco trough was 347 on  and 198 on  his vancomycin dosing was decreased to 1 gram q24 hrs and a dose was given the morning of  gentle ivfs given to patient and his lasix was held for several days and his creatinine improved back to his baselinehypertension benign well controlled and normotensive during hospital course continued on beta blocker as above with no need to add other agents his home diltiazem was discontinued   copd chronic at baseline on home oxygen at 25l by time of discharge currently has o2 saturations in the mid  range and has no complaints of worse wheeze or shortness of

brief he was taken to the operating room on admission from the ed  there was a large mesenteric tear and associated small bowel ischemia  this was resected he had a ileo cecectomy with primary anastomosis  he also was noted to have a liver laceration with associated liver ischemia this was debrided  postop he was monitored in the icu and was noted to be persistently tachycardic with an increasing pressor requirement his lactate was elevated and rising and he was taken back to the or for a  look laparotomy also on   approximately 1 liter of blood was found and an internal hernia he was hemostatic at the end of the case and he was returned to the icu  the rest of his hospital course by systems below but in brief was characterized by a prolonged wean from the ventilator finally extubated on  and liver necrosis and eventual fluid collection which was drained by  his course is described below by systemneuro  he was initially sedated while intubated with a combination of propofol fentanyl and versed but this was weaned as appropriate and after extubation he was treated with dilaudid for pain orthopedic spine evaluation was requested for the cervical spine fracture this was treated non operatively with a cervical collar he will follow up in approx 4 weeks with dr  have repeat spine films done he was alert and oriented x 3 and neurologically intact with some bilateral upper extremity weakness that had improved during his admissioncardiac patient was hypotensive during the initial days postop and required pressors he was weaned off levophed on pod3 echo was performed to evaluate for blunt cardiac injury and the heart appeared hyperdynamic with no wall motion abnormalities patient was resuscitated with prbc and albumin  he remained hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his hospital course resp  he was intubated initially on scene then remained intubated postoperatively through two trips to the or  initially requiring high peeps this was eventually weaned though he continued to struggle with poor oxygenation and inability to wean from the vent likely due to a combination of pneumonia noted on cxr bal after bronch on  grew mssa and fluid overload  he was placed on a lasix drip to remove excess fluid and treated with levofloxacin started on  for the pneumonia he was eventually weaned to extubation on  he remained on 40mg po lasix daily while on the floor and continued to diurese well he was changed to diamox on  to avoid hypercarbia his supplemental oxygen was weaned and his oxygen saturation remained stable on room air continued pulmonary toileting and incentive spirometry were encouraged  on  he underwent diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis for 15l and he symptomatically improved with saturations remaining in the mid to high 90s follow up cxr showed interval decrease in right pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax after thoracentesis gi patient was taken for emergent laparotomy on the night of admission postop patient had persistent lactic acidosis and hypotension patient was taken back to or for reexploration also on  as noted above  he started to spike temperatures on   in combination with his downtrending hct to 24 a ct scan was obtained on  it showed a fluid collection near a necrotic portion of the liver with fluid in the right paracolic gutter  hepatobiliary surgery was consulted and recommended a triple phase ct to assess progression of the liver ischemianecrosis one week later this was done on  to aid in surgical planning regarding debridement  he was taken by  on  for drainage of the fluid collection near the drain  cultures grew mixed bacteria as well as b fragilis he was started on flagyl on  along with levofloxacinhe had a triple phase ct on  which demonstrated progression of necrosis with expected walling offorganization of the liver necrosis  also of note on  the drainage from his liver collection drain placed  by  changed from serosanguinousyellow to thicker brown  there was concern that this was stool from a leak in his anastomosis so he was sent down urgently for a ct scan with contrast injected through the drain  the contrast did not enter the bowel which was reassuring  the drainage color change was attributed to additional necrosis of the liver which was now sloughing off and draining through the drainon transfer to the floor on  his tube feeds were discontinued and he was started on a regular diet nutritional supplements were added he tolerated a regular diet and was started on a bowel regimen he was discharged to home with the drainage catheter in place teaching was provided to patient and his wife on the  and monitoring of the drainage catheter systemgu on admission patient was in acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis he was aggressively hydrated and his creatinine improved with downtrend in his ck from 120000 to 700 after which the level was no longer checked as his urine output was excellent and his creatinine normalized  his urine output was normal throughout his stay on the floor he was diuresed as discussed above under respiratory a foley catheter remained in place for urine output monitoring until  at which time it was removed and he voided without difficulty he was noted with scrotal edema primarily related to fluid overload this did eventually improve significantly with intermittent diuresis using lasix which was later changed to diamoxid patient began to spike fevers on pod4  he was started on levofloxacin as noted above for an mssa pneumonia and completed a 7 day course that was dcd on   the flagyl was also started on  due to the cultures from the drain growing bacteroides  this was continued until  at time of discharge he was afebrile with a normal white

was able to tolerate supplements  the gi consult team saw the patient and recommended a barium swallow study that showed mild esophageal dysmotility and mild reflux she also underwent a video swallow that revealed no upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction despite very mild narrowing at the sphincter felt highly unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms a zinc level was sent to assess zinc deficiency as a source of her dysphagia  this was pending at the time of discharge  the patient was started on diltiazem for her esophageal spasms of note atenolol and amlodipine were held and simvastatin was switched to atorvastatin given the interaction between simvastatin and diltiazem at the time of discharge the patient was able to tolerate soft solids and liquids  she was scheduled  with her outpatient gastroenterologist and pcp to assess effect of diltiazem andor restart prior antihypertensive medications electrolyte abnormalities the patient has has chronic hyponatremia per report and records but was found on presentation to have hypomagnesemia hypokalemia hypochloremia and hypophosphatemia in the setting of decreased po intake for 1 month  given her elevated lactate on admission that decreased in response to fluids the etiology was thought most likely due poor po intake  it was also felt that the patients furosemide contributed andor precipitated her current electrolyte abnormalities and her prior admission in  the patient was advised not take lasix but the patient was insistent upon restarting her lasix  in total the patient received 10 l of fluid in the  ed and micu as well as electrolyte supplementation with significant improvement in electrolytes monitoring included ekg that was without uwaves or ischemic changes she was transferred to the medical

issuesmedication changes diltiazem 30mg qid was started for esophageal spasms atenolol was stopped because diltiazem was started amlodipine was stopped because diltiazem was started simvastatin was stopped because it interacts with diltiazem and atorvastatin was started instead  if her diltiazem is not helping her symptoms it would be reasonable to restart her home antihypertensive regimen patient was cautioned to stop the diltiazem if she experiences dizziness or lightheadedness  the patient was encouraged to stop her lasix given concern that it is source of her electrolyte abnormalities but she was adamant about continuing this medication she will likely continue despite our strong warning against it other issues patient has a pending zinc level low zinc can also cause many electrolyte disturbances consistent with her picture so she should be repleted if this level is low and worked up for causes of low zinc possibly simple low dietary intake given her eating issues

dysphagia  she has a history of chronic nausea and dysphagia for the last several years and has undergone an extensive workup as an outpatient egd in  confirmed  esophagus she also has had barium swallow esophageal manometry gastric emptying studies in  without significant positive results it is likely that anxiety may also be contributing to symptoms particularly her anticipatory nausea including nausea upon smelling foods she had a recent ct abdomen which showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm with insinuation of the colonic hepatic flexure between the liver and hemidiaphragm chilaiditi sign based on these results she was evaluated by the bariatric surgery team while inpatient per surgery although eventually a diagnostic laparoscopy to look for an adhesionkink could be

nausea siadh patient had na 131 on admission which downtrended to 128 day prior to discharge urine electrolytes were sent and were notable for urine osm 404 and urine na 167 high urine osm in the

interventions who presents with word finding difficulties and recent fallssubacute left globus pallidus infarct initial noncontrast headache ct was negative for acute hemorrhage and alteplase was not administered due to extended duration of symptoms and thrombectomy was not done dt no large vessel occlusion mri head w contrast revealed a possible subacute infarct in left basal ganglia exam was notable for very subtle apraxia neglect and migrographia which the patient said was new she had mild hesitancy in her speech but no aphasia clinically the patient appeared to be improving however had two episodes on  in which the patient experienced nausea and bradycardia heart rate in  and was briefly unresponsive for a few seconds the first of these episodes began while the patient was walking with  with bradycardia and unresponsiveness occurring after the patient lay down she regained conscious within a few seconds the second episode occurred while the patient was sitting in bed and included a 55 second pause on telemetry with loss of consciousness left eye deviation left head turning and bilateral upper extremity shaking she regained consciousness in 30 seconds and was noted to have new right facial droop right upper extremity weakness and fluent aphasia with word salad nihss at this time was 10 imaging at that time including noncontrast head ct and cta were unremarkable and following ct nihss improved to 5 alteplase was not administered due fluctuating exam and rapid improvement exam continued to improve with only mild aphasia eeg was done that showed mild left sided slowing but no discharges or electrographic seizures likely episode of eye deviation head deviation and upper extremity shaking iso bradycarida and sinus pause was convulsive syncope mri head without contrast later revealed stable subacute infarct in the left globus pallidus without any new areas of infarct or hemorrhage stroke risk factors include tsh 04 fasting lipid panel ldl 123 and hba1c 77 she was started on aspirin 81mg and her simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin 40mg likely etiology of stokes is small vessellacunar cognitive decline felt that likely some of her symptoms were due to overlying dementia that may have been worsening as patient lives alone and per family recently stopped taking her medications b12 and rpr were checked and were normal unclear how well she has been functioning at home prior to this as she lives alone she also has had repeated falls at home which she is unable to describe or explain htn her hypertensive medications were held other than hctz to allow blood pressure to autoregulate she was noted to be intermittently hypertensive and her home medications were restarted there were held again after syncope described above prior to discharge she was restarted on amlodipine but losartan and hctz were held syncope during hospitalization as described above she had had a series of episodes of bradycardia during the first episode she became unresponsive and was noted to be bradycardic to as low as the  on telemetry with a 3 second pause followed by subsequent hypertension and tachycardia up to the 110 bpm range about 10 minutes later she had a similar episode finally after she had been stabilized in bed a third episode of bradycardia occurred with a documented 55 second pause and associated period of unresponsiveness after she recovered she had worsened aphasia as well as weakness and facial droop as described above telemetry was considered to be consistent with vagal etiology without nodal block she has no prior history of arrhythmias or conduction disease transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which revealed normal biventricular systolic function no cardiac source of embolus ep cardiology was consulted and felt that these episodes were consistent with vasovagal and did not warrant any further investigation or intervention we discussed worry that this episode may have caused some increased hypoperfusion and reinfarction iso new facial droop weakness and aphasia after syncope ep felt that since likely vasovagual there was no indication for pacemaker as this would not prevent the vasodilation associated with vasovagual and would not prevent hypoperfusion they felt that if highly symptomatic episodes continue even with vagal triggers minimized in the future all nodal blockade should be avoided she has been scheduled for cardiology follow up she was discharged with  of hearts monitor diabetes glucose was monitored throughout stay and insulin administered on sliding scale hbga1c 77 per daughter she has not been taking her medications for at least a the past week or so she was restarted on home metformin at discharge she has an endocrinology appointment scheduled for this month  transitional
